Support Assistant – AI Agent

This project is developed as part of the 48-Hour AI Agent Development Challenge.
The Support Assistant is designed to help users by answering FAQs, resolving simple support queries, and identifying cases that require human intervention.

1. Overview

The Support Assistant is an AI-powered tool that responds to user queries based on a predefined knowledge base. It helps automate basic customer support tasks such as answering common questions, giving quick replies, and escalating complex issues to a human support team.

The agent uses an LLM model for natural language understanding and a small FAQ dataset as its knowledge source.

2. Features

FAQ-Based Responses: Answers common questions using internal FAQ data.

Complex Query Detection: Flags issues that require human support.

Clean Streamlit Interface: Simple and easy-to-use UI.

Instant Responses: Generates replies in real-time.

Extendable: FAQ data and model logic can be modified easily.
